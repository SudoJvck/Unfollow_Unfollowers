# Unfollow_Unfollowers
This python script was created to unfollow people who have unfollowed you on Twitter.

Requirements:
- Python
- Tweepy (Pip install tweepy)
- Twitter API Keys and Access Tokens: To use the Twitter API, you will need to have a Twitter account and apply for a Twitter Developer account. Once you have a Twitter Developer account, you will be able to create a new Twitter app and obtain the necessary API keys and access tokens.


Note:

- Please note that using the Twitter API has limitations and rate limits, so you may need to be careful when making a large number of requests. You can learn more about the rate limits for the Twitter API by visiting the Twitter Developer website.

- If Twitter does start charging for access to its API, you may need to update the script to include the necessary payment information or to use an alternative source of data. It's also possible that the rate limits and available data may change, so you may need to update the script to account for these changes as well.
